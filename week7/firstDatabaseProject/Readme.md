# Connecting database with node

```shell
npm init -y
```

creates the package json file

for conecting the database to node.js

we are using the NODE.JS CONNECTOR

use the promise version
(promised based api - is much easier to handle)

then install mariadb library

## install mariadb -library

```shell
npm install mariadb
```

creates node modules library inside our project
doesn't work without the library

## re-installing node modules from dependencies

```shell
later you can only run npm install
```

but the package json needas to be there before.
